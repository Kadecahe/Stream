        Stream is an application that allows you to choose a mood for
        meditation, and will return a playlist to play on your Spotify device.
        To start, log in with Spotify on our navigation bar and make sure to
        have Spotify running on your background first! The application was built
        to test Spotify's Web API. In its next stage, the application will work
        with iPhone devices.
